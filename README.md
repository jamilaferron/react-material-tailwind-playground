# Using Tailwind CSS and Material Tailwind
### Tailwind CSS
- Tailwind CSS is already set up in this project. The configuration file, `tailwind.config.js`, is
  where you can modify theme settings or extend the default Tailwind classes.
- In React components, you can use Tailwind CSS utility classes directly within JSX to style
  elements.
### Material Tailwind
- Material Tailwind components are available for use, making it easy to build beautiful UI
  elements.
- The components are pre-installed, but you can reinstall with:
```bash
npm install @material-tailwind/react
```
- Refer to the [Material Tailwind Documentation](https://www.material-tailwind.com/docs/react/installation) to learn more about the available components.
  
## Example: AvatarGroup Component
- The AvatarGroup component is an example of how to create and style a simple group of avatar
  images using Material Tailwind components and Tailwind CSS.

### Location:
The component is located in `src/components/AvatarGroup.js`.

### How to Use:
1. Import the Component: In your own component, you can import the `AvatarGroup` like this:
```jsx
import AvatarGroup from './components/AvatarGroup';
```

2. Add to JSX: You can add the `AvatarGroup` inside your JSX like this:
```jsx
<AvatarGroup />
```

### Explanation:
The `AvatarGroup` component uses the ``Avatar component from Material Tailwind to display 
multiple avatars with different sizes. The layout is styled using Tailwind CSS utility 
classes for flexibility and ease of use.

Hereâ€™s the code for the component:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Avatar } from "@material-tailwind/react";

const AvatarGroup = () => {
  return (
    <div className="flex w-max items-end gap-4">
      <Avatar src="https://docs.material-tailwind.com/img/face-2.jpg" alt="avatar" size="xs" />
      <Avatar src="https://docs.material-tailwind.com/img/face-2.jpg" alt="avatar" size="sm" />
      <Avatar src="https://docs.material-tailwind.com/img/face-2.jpg" alt="avatar" size="md" />
      <Avatar src="https://docs.material-tailwind.com/img/face-2.jpg" alt="avatar" size="lg" />
      <Avatar src="https://docs.material-tailwind.com/img/face-2.jpg" alt="avatar" size="xl" />
      <Avatar src="https://docs.material-tailwind.com/img/face-2.jpg" alt="avatar" size="xxl" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default AvatarGroup;
```
This component can serve as a reference for building your own components using a combination of 
React, Tailwind CSS, and Material Tailwind.

## Example: App Component
The `App` component is the main entry point of this React app. It demonstrates how you can integrate 
the custom `AvatarGroup` component and manage the layout using Tailwind CSS.

### Code:
```jsx
import "./App.css";
import AvatarGroup from "./components/AvatarGroup";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <AvatarGroup />
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Explanation:
- The `App` component imports `AvatarGroup` and uses it within the `header` section. This serves as an example
  of how to import and integrate custom components in a React project.
- You can experiment with this by adding your own components or modifying the layout using Tailwind CSS
  utility classes, as seen in the example.

## Usage
Feel free to modify or extend the existing components. Use them as a reference for learning how to structure, 
style, and build components with React, Tailwind CSS, and Material Tailwind.
